# Timeline App

A web-based timeline visualization project built as part of the JavaScript School Project.  
This app will display events in a chronological, interactive timeline format using semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚧 Stage 1 – Static Skeleton (Task 1)

### ✅ Goals:
- Set up the basic HTML structure for the timeline application.
- Ensure semantic HTML usage with accessibility and future expansion in mind.

### 🏗️ Current Structure:
- `<header>` with placeholder for logo and theme toggle.
- `<nav>` for future filters or controls (currently empty).
- `<main>` with a `<section id="timeline">` to hold all timeline events.
- `<div id="modal">` for future event popups or detail views.

### 📁 Files:
- `index.html` — contains the static skeleton layout.
- `README.md` — project documentation.

### 📌 Next Steps:
- Add dynamic rendering of timeline events using JavaScript.
- Implement filter controls in the `<nav>` area.
- Style the application using CSS and support theme switching.
